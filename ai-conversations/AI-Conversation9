Topic: Adding interactive button handlers with ipywidgets

Me: Now I want to code what happens when someone clicks “Fetch Weather.” Can you show me an example of how to handle that?

AI: Sure. You can use a click handler like this:

def on_fetch_button_clicked(b, location_input, days_input, output_area):
    with output_area:
        output_area.clear_output()
        loc = location_input.value
        if not loc:
            print("⚠️ Please enter a location.")
            return

        data = get_weather_data(loc, forecast_days=6)
        if data and data.get("list"):
            current = data["list"][0]
            print(f"✨ Weather for {loc}: ✨")
            print(f"🌡️ Currently: {current['main']['temp']:.1f}°C with {current['weather'][0]['description']}")


You can add logic for displaying the average temperature and advice at the end.

Me: I also want the app to remember the last location so users don’t have to type again. How can I do that?

AI: You can store it in a global variable, for example _LAST_LOCATION. Then, when the user clicks again, the function can check if the location changed. If not, it can reuse the existing data.

Me: That’s clever. I’ll do the same for _LAST_WEATHER and _LAST_FORECAST_DAYS.

AI: Perfect. You can also use similar logic for your “Show Temperature Chart” and “Show Precipitation Chart” buttons, just replace the print statements with calls to create_temperature_visualisation() or create_precipitation_visualisation().

Me: I’ve finished writing on_temp_chart_button_clicked() and on_precip_chart_button_clicked(). They both check the location, fetch data if missing, and display a chart.

AI: That sounds great. Those functions will make your interface truly interactive.
