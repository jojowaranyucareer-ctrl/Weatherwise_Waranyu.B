Topic: Testing openWeather_getWeather, get_weather_data, and get_temps functions

Me: I want to test them properly to make sure they actually return valid data from OpenWeatherMap.

AI: That’s a great idea. Testing is an important step before connecting your functions to the interface. You can start by calling each function with a known city, like London or Tokyo, and print or display parts of the data to confirm it’s structured correctly.

Me: I wrote this small test script:

print("Testing openWeather_getWeather...")
sample_city = "London"
weather_raw_data = openWeather_getWeather(city=sample_city)

if weather_raw_data:
    print(f"Successfully fetched raw weather data for {sample_city}. Data structure preview:")
    display(list(weather_raw_data.keys()))
    if weather_raw_data.get("list"):
        print("First item in 'list':")
        display(weather_raw_data["list"][0])
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch raw weather data for {sample_city}.")


It should print the top-level keys and the first forecast entry to confirm the API works.

AI: That’s perfect. It checks both the existence of data and the internal list. The keys help you see the structure (like 'city', 'list', 'cnt'), and showing the first list item confirms that you’re getting forecast data with temperature, humidity, and description fields.

Me: I ran it and got valid data for London. Then I tested get_weather_data() with “Tokyo.” Here’s the second part of my script:

print("\nTesting get_weather_data...")
sample_city_2 = "Tokyo"
sample_days = 3
weather_processed_data = get_weather_data(city=sample_city_2, forecast_days=sample_days)

if weather_processed_data:
    print(f"Successfully fetched and processed weather data for {sample_city_2} for {sample_days} days. Data structure preview:")
    display(list(weather_processed_data.keys()))
    if weather_processed_data.get("list"):
         print("First item in 'list':")
         display(weather_processed_data["list"][0])
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch weather data for {sample_city_2}.")


AI: Excellent. That test ensures that your higher-level function still calls the API correctly and handles multiple days.

Me: After that, I added this part to test my get_temps() function:

if 'weather_raw_data' in locals() and weather_raw_data and weather_raw_data.get("list"):
    daily_temperatures = get_temps(weather_raw_data)
    print("Successfully extracted daily temperatures. Preview:")
    display(daily_temperatures)
else:
    print("Skipping get_temps test as raw weather data is not available or not fetched.")


It worked fine — I got a dictionary with dates as keys and lists of temperatures as values.

AI: That’s great to hear. The output of get_temps() confirms that your parsing logic correctly splits the timestamps into daily groups. You’ve now verified that all three key functions work together end-to-end.

Me: Yes, I think I can move on to the interface testing next.

AI: Perfect. You’ve finished the technical verification part. Now your system is ready for user interaction and AI response generation.
