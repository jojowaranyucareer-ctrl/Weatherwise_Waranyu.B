Topic: Finishing the WeatherWise interface with Quit functionality and layout setup

Me: I also want a simple “Quit” button that clears everything and says goodbye.

AI: That’s easy to add. You can create a small function like this:

def on_quit_button_clicked(b, output_area):
    with output_area:
        output_area.clear_output()
        print("👋 Goodbye!")


This just clears the display and prints a message. You can link it to a widgets.Button the same way as the others.

Me: Great. For the layout, I want all buttons stacked vertically under the input fields. Is VBox still the best choice?

AI: Yes, widgets.VBox() works perfectly for vertical stacking. You can also group inputs and buttons separately, then combine them into the main layout. Here’s how you can structure it:

input_widgets = widgets.VBox([location_input, days_input, question_input])
button_widgets = widgets.VBox([fetch_button, temp_chart_button, precip_chart_button, should_go_outside_button, ask_question_button, quit_button])
ui = widgets.VBox([
    widgets.Label("Hello! I'm your WeatherWise assistant."),
    input_widgets,
    button_widgets,
    output_area
])


Me: That looks clean. And I should use lambda functions to pass inputs to each handler, right?

AI: Exactly. Use something like:

fetch_button.on_click(lambda b: on_fetch_button_clicked(b, location_input, days_input, output_area))
should_go_outside_button.on_click(lambda b: on_should_go_outside_button_clicked(b, location_input, output_area))


That way, your handlers receive the right arguments.

Me: Perfect. I just ran it, and the UI appears nicely in Jupyter Notebook. All buttons work smoothly.

AI: That’s fantastic. You’ve built a full interactive weather system that combines data processing, visualisation, and AI conversation — all with a clean interface.

Me: I’m really proud of this one. Thank you for helping me structure it so well.

AI: You should be proud. This is a professional-level mini-project — great job finishing it off!
