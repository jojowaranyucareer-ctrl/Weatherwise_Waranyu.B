Topic: Designing the WeatherWise user interface and temperature advice system

Me: I want to create a simple user interface using ipywidgets. I want users to type a location, click buttons like “Show Chart” or “Ask AI,” and see the result in the notebook. How should I start?

AI: Great idea. You can use ipywidgets to build an interactive interface right inside Jupyter Notebook. The main structure should include input fields for location and question, a few buttons for actions, and one output area to display results. You’ll also need handler functions for each button.

Me: Okay, so each button will call a different function like “fetch weather” or “show chart”?

AI: Exactly. You can write functions such as:

on_fetch_button_clicked() for retrieving weather

on_temp_chart_button_clicked() for showing temperature charts

on_precip_chart_button_clicked() for precipitation

on_should_go_outside_button_clicked() for giving tomorrow’s advice

on_ask_question_button_clicked() for the AI Q&A

Then, create a create_weather_ui() function to put everything together.

Me: I also want to give users some friendly advice about the temperature, like “it’s hot, stay indoors.” Should that be part of the UI or a separate helper function?

AI: It’s best to make it a helper function. You can call it get_temperature_advice(average_temp). It takes a number (°C) and returns a short text message. For example:

def get_temperature_advice(average_temp: float) -> str:
    if average_temp > 32:
        return "Advice: 🔥 It's scorching hot out there! Best to stay indoors and crank up the AC."
    elif average_temp >= 27:
        return "Advice: ☀️ Feeling quite warm today! Light clothing and sunscreen are your friends."
    elif average_temp >= 23:
        return "Advice: 👍 Perfect weather today! Enjoy your time outside!"
    elif average_temp >= 17:
        return "Advice: 🧣 A bit chilly! Don't forget a warm layer if you're heading out."
    else:
        return "Advice: 🥶 Brrr, it's freezing! Stay cozy inside and keep warm."


Me: That’s perfect. I’ll use that to display daily advice after showing the current weather.

AI: Great plan. Once that’s ready, you can integrate it with your “Fetch Weather” button so it prints both the forecast and a daily temperature tip.
