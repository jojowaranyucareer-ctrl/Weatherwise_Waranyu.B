Topic: Adding ‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù and finalising the WeatherWise user interface

Me: The last part I need to add is a button where users can ask weather questions, and it will use the AI to answer.

AI: You can create another handler called on_ask_question_button_clicked(). It should:

Get the question text and location.

Fetch the latest weather data if needed.

Parse the question using your parse_weather_question() function.

Pass both the parsed question and weather data to generate_weather_response().

Print the AI‚Äôs reply.

Me: Like this?

def on_ask_question_button_clicked(b, location_input, question_input, output_area):
    with output_area:
        output_area.clear_output()
        question = question_input.value
        loc = location_input.value

        if not loc:
            print("‚ö†Ô∏è Please enter a location.")
            return
        if not question:
            print("‚ùì Please enter a question.")
            return

        print("ü§ñ Asking AI...")
        parsed_question = parse_weather_question(question)
        ai_response = generate_weather_response(parsed_question, _LAST_WEATHER)
        print("\n‚ú® AI Response: ‚ú®")
        print(ai_response)


AI: Exactly. That‚Äôs clean and straightforward. It connects all your earlier work into one interactive flow.

Me: Nice. I also added a ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù button and a create_weather_ui() function that puts everything together using widgets for input and buttons.

AI: That completes your WeatherWise interface. You now have a fully interactive weather assistant that can fetch, visualise, and respond to questions through AI ‚Äî all inside Jupyter Notebook.

Me: Thanks! This was my favourite part to build. Seeing everything come together feels great.

AI: You‚Äôve done a really good job integrating multiple technologies into one cohesive project.
