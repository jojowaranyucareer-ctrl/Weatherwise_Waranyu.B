Topic: Creating the “Should We Go Outside Tomorrow?” feature

Me: I want to add another button that helps users decide if it’s a good idea to go outside tomorrow. It should use tomorrow’s forecast to give advice like “too hot,” “too cold,” or “rainy.” How should I build this?

AI: That’s a great idea. You can create a new button handler called on_should_go_outside_button_clicked(). It will follow the same structure as your other handlers:

Get the location from the input.

Fetch new data if it’s missing or outdated.

Collect tomorrow’s weather data from the forecast (indices 8–15).

Calculate average temperature, total precipitation, and wind speed.

Print a summary and give advice based on those values.

Me: So it’s almost like an extension of the “Fetch Weather” function, but only focused on tomorrow, right?

AI: Exactly. You can reuse your previous logic for finding tomorrow’s data points. Here’s the structure:

def on_should_go_outside_button_clicked(b, location_input, output_area):
    with output_area:
        output_area.clear_output()
        loc = location_input.value
        if not loc:
            print("⚠️ Please enter a location.")
            return

        global _LAST_WEATHER, _LAST_LOCATION
        if not _LAST_WEATHER or _LAST_LOCATION != loc:
            print(f"🔄 Fetching weather data for {loc}...")
            data = get_weather_data(loc, forecast_days=6)
            _LAST_WEATHER = data
            _LAST_LOCATION = loc

        if not _LAST_WEATHER or not _LAST_WEATHER.get("list"):
            print("❌ Could not retrieve forecast data.")
            return

        tomorrow_data_points = _LAST_WEATHER["list"][8:16]
        tomorrow_temps = [item["main"]["temp"] for item in tomorrow_data_points]
        average_temp = sum(tomorrow_temps) / len(tomorrow_temps)
        precipitation = sum(item.get("rain", {}).get("3h", 0) for item in tomorrow_data_points)


Me: Nice. I also want it to show emoji advice like “🌧️ It will rain” or “🥶 It’s freezing.” Can I just add if-statements for that?

AI: Yes, that’s perfect. Add a few conditions like this:

if precipitation > 0.5:
    print("🌧️ Advice: It might rain tomorrow. You may want to stay inside or carry an umbrella.")
elif average_temp < 10:
    print("🥶 Advice: It will be cold tomorrow. Dress warmly if you go out.")
elif average_temp > 30:
    print("🥵 Advice: It’s going to be hot. Stay hydrated and avoid direct sunlight.")
else:
    print("👍 Advice: The weather looks great for outdoor activities!")


Me: That’s exactly the kind of logic I wanted. I added wind speed and weather description too for more context.

AI: Excellent addition. Showing wind and description makes it more complete and helpful for users. Once you add that, your “Should We Go Outside Tomorrow?” button will feel like a personal assistant giving recommendations.

Me: Perfect. I’ll add that as one of the last buttons in the interface.

AI: Great. Once this is in place, your weather assistant will not only display forecasts but also interpret them intelligently.
