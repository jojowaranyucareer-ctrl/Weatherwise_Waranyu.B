# üìí PROMPTING.md
Below are five focused examples that combine my actual prompts, the intentional prompting technique used, why it helped, and short **Before/After** code that shows measurable improvements in stability, correctness, readability, and UX. Each example also links back to the assessment requirements: modular design, error handling, testing, visuals, and documentation quality.

## 1) UI Planning and Advice Helper

**Topic:** Planning the `ipywidgets` UI and adding `get_temperature_advice`  
**Prompt:** ‚ÄúI want a simple ipywidgets UI where users type a location and click buttons like Show Chart or Ask AI. How should I start?‚Äù  
**Technique:** Restate the problem and identify inputs and outputs  
**Why it helped:** It forced a clear component plan before code and avoided mixing UI with logic.

### Before
```python
# Idea only. No structure for widgets, no separation of UI vs logic.
```
### AI Response (summary)
- Create widgets: Text (location), Int (days), Buttons (Fetch, Temp Chart, Precip Chart, Ask AI, Quit), and an Output area.  
- Wire small handlers that call focused functions.  
- Add a helper `get_temperature_advice(avg_c)` for user guidance.

### After
```python
location_input = widgets.Text(placeholder="e.g., Sydney")
days_input = widgets.IntText(value=5, min=1, max=6)
temp_chart_button = widgets.Button(description="Show Temperature Chart")
precip_chart_button = widgets.Button(description="Show Precipitation Chart")
ask_question_button = widgets.Button(description="Ask AI")
output_area = widgets.Output()

def get_temperature_advice(avg_c: float) -> str:
    if avg_c > 32: return "Very hot. Stay hydrated."
    if avg_c >= 27: return "Warm. Sunscreen recommended."
    if avg_c >= 23: return "Comfortable."
    if avg_c >= 17: return "A bit cool. Light layer."
    return "Cold. Dress warmly."
```

## 2) Chart Buttons with Caching and Guards

**Topic:** Handlers for temperature and precipitation charts  
**Prompt:** ‚ÄúHow should the temperature and precipitation chart handlers reuse data and validate inputs?‚Äù  
**Technique:** Request modular design improvements and challenge edge cases  
**Why it helped:** Reduced API calls and improved responsiveness while preventing confusing errors.

### Before
```python
def on_temp_chart_button_clicked(b):
    data = get_weather_data(location_input.value)  # refetch on every click
    create_temperature_visualisation(data, num_days=5)
```
### AI Response (summary)
- Cache the last dataset and location.  
- Validate empty location.  
- If data is missing, show a clear message and exit early.

### After
```python
if not _LAST_WEATHER or _LAST_LOCATION != loc:
    _LAST_WEATHER = get_weather_data(loc, forecast_days=6)
    _LAST_LOCATION = loc

if not _LAST_WEATHER or not _LAST_WEATHER.get("list"):
    print("Weather data is not available. Please fetch weather first.")
    return

create_temperature_visualisation(_LAST_WEATHER, num_days=days_input.value)
```

## 3) Correct Tomorrow Indexing Using 3-Hour Cadence

**Topic:** Getting tomorrow‚Äôs summary from 3-hour forecasts  
**Prompt:** ‚ÄúExplain why [8:16] is used for tomorrow and show how to compute averages and precipitation totals.‚Äù  
**Technique:** Ask for code explanations to ensure understanding  
**Why it helped:** Locked in the correct mapping from 3-hour slots to a full day.

### Before
```python
tomorrow_points = weather_data["list"][0:8]  # incorrect for tomorrow
```
### AI Response (summary)
- There are **8 chunks per day** at **3 hours** each.  
- Use **[8:16]** for the next day, then compute **averages** and **totals** from that slice.

### After
```python
tomorrow_points = weather_data["list"][8:16]

avg_temp = sum(i["main"]["temp"] for i in tomorrow_points) / len(tomorrow_points)

precip = sum(
    i.get("rain", {}).get("3h", 0) + i.get("snow", {}).get("3h", 0)
    for i in tomorrow_points
)
```

## 4) Retrieval Stability and Live Testing

**Topic:** Testing `openWeather_getWeather` and `get_weather_data` and handling failures  
**Prompt:** ‚ÄúI want to test `openWeather_getWeather` and `get_weather_data` for London and Tokyo. Show me how to print keys, the first list item, and handle failures.‚Äù  
**Technique:** Identify inputs and outputs, then iterate based on tests  
**Why it helped:** Validated structure early, exposed missing keys and network issues, stabilized downstream logic.

### Before
```python
def openWeather_getWeather(city, units="metric"):
    return requests.get(url).json()  # no key check, no timeout, no try/except
```
### AI Response (summary)
- Read API key from environment, not from code.  
- Add a request timeout and wrap in `try/except`.  
- Print top-level keys and preview the first forecast entry.  
- Guard for a missing `list` in the response.

### After
```python
def openWeather_getWeather(city: str, units: str = "metric"):
    api_key = os.getenv("OPENWEATHER_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        return None
    try:
        url = (
            "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast"
            f"?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units={units}"
        )
        resp = requests.get(url, timeout=15)
        return resp.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching weather data: {e}")
        return None

# Tests
if weather_raw_data:
    print(list(weather_raw_data.keys()))
    if weather_raw_data.get("list"):
        print(weather_raw_data["list"][0])
```
